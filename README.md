# Number-Guessing-Game
This project is a simple yet engaging terminal-based Number Guessing Game developed in C by Parneet Kaur
The game challenges the player to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
After each guess, the program provides helpful hints—letting the player know whether they should guess higher or lower—until the correct number is guessed. 
The game keeps track of the number of attempts and congratulates the player once they succeed. 
It uses core C programming concepts such as rand() and srand() for random number generation, do-while loops for repeated attempts, and if-else conditionals to guide the gameplay. 
This project is ideal for beginners learning C as it demonstrates user input handling, control flow, and basic logic in an interactive way. 
To run the game, simply compile the source file using a C compiler like gcc and execute the generated binary from your terminal. 
It’s a lightweight, fun program perfect for learning or refreshing your C programming skills.
